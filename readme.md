| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1           | humanYears: 1 ; catYears: 15 ; dogYears: 15    |
| 2           | humanYears: 2 ; catYears: 24 ; dogYears: 24    |
| 3           | humanYears: 3 ; catYears: 28 ; dogYears: 29    |

The function is taking the actual age of human years and converting it
to the equivlent in cat and dog years. The function will return 15 years for both
dogs and cats if the actual human year is 1 , and will return 24  for both cat and dog years if the actual human year is 2.
after that , what ever number is given for actual age it will return the actual age 
for human years and run an Expression  for both dogs and cats respectively, to 
determine the equivalent in dog and cat years.
